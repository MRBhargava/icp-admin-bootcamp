### Where do I find the IBM community for managing RHEL
The IBM RHEL community can be found rom [this wiki](https://ftp3.linux.ibm.com/)
From that site there is the [RHEL Linux Updates site](https://ftp3.linux.ibm.com/redhat_updates.php)
Get the RHN yum repo script [fresh from the IBM site](https://ftp3.linux.ibm.com/internal_satellite/) or use the one [we downloaded previously here](https://github.ibm.com/jabbott/CIL-ICP/blob/master/scripts/ibm-rhsm.sh). Download that

There is a limit for the number of systems you can register.  Alternatively the ibm-yum.sh script can be used.  Read the usage to set ftp3 credentials as environment variables.

Get fresh builds of RHEL at the [RHN-RedHat Network](https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/271/ver=/rhel---7/7.4.4/x86_64/product-software) <br/>
